# 📝 Conclusion

Once dabbled in the three view engines, the preferred one is <strong style="color: #ffca28; text-decoration: underline;">EJS</strong>, since it offers a syntax very similar to HTML, wich allows for a shortened learning curve. Maybe the escape tags (<%, <%=) are confusing, but with a little practice they are easily controlled.
Something similar happens with HANDLEBARS, their syntax is familiar and the escapes to js are understandable. I simply chose EJS by convention.
Quite the opposite happens with PUG. Its syntax is not very familiar (at least to my knowledge), which implies having to learn a new syntax.
